World Wide Wohnung is a web application that aims to make apartment search easier for people who want to live in flat-share or solely for himself. Whether you're moving to a different country or a different city within the same country, finding a suitable apartment can be challenging, considering various factors such as location, rent, neighbors/flatmates. World Wide Wohnung aims to simplify this process by providing a platform that helps users find apartments based on their preferences. As I am still developing it, very few features are currently available. With time it the complete solution for house search â™¥
